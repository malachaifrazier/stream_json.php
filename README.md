# stream_json.php

HTML5 [**stream.json**](http://nathanpc.github.com/stream.json/) client written in PHP.

## What is this?

This is a simple client I've written to make it easy for people to start using [stream.json](http://nathanpc.github.com/stream.json/).

## How does it look like?

![Doesn't it look awesome?](http://f.cl.ly/items/09271R1T453V031v1S20/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-26%20at%205.37.33%20PM.png)

As I've said it's very simple, but it's still just the first version so there's a lot to improve.

## TODO

Some of the things that are going to come on the next versions:

- Mobile version
- Preferences panel
- More customizations
- Design improvements
